## Features

- **Real-Time Suggestions**: Instantly see relevant options as you typeâ€”across the full alphabet.
- **Secure by Default**: All database access (Upstash Redis) is done via API routes, never exposing secrets to the client.
- **Polished UX**: Fully responsive, themed interface with a minimalist "Flash" title and visually rich dropdown.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Next.js API routes handle fetching, seeding, and serving data efficiently.
